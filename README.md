## LEXPWatch - XP monitoring for Last Epoch ##

This is VERY much work-in-progress - sharing for feedback/ideas!

### What it Does ###
It monitors your Player.log/save slots and reports how much XP you're earning when playing and specifically in each 'area' you enter/leave

### How it does it ###
Python - I've tried to avoid using external dependencies - I think everything it uses is 'core' but I might be wrong about that - let me know!
|
### How to Use ###
Clone the repo and run lewatch.py - it runs forever, Ctrl-Break to halt it.

Output goes to console - redirect it to a file if you'd prefer!

I've included the path for Linux installs but I don't have a way to test that so feedback apprec on that too!

### It's not working/I'd like different stats/Help! ###

Fire an Issue and I'll try to help!
